# Mechanical Keyboard Guide
This is a guide to mechanical keyboards.

### Parts of a keyboard
- Switches: switches are small mechanical pieces consisting of a housing, spring, stem, leaf that are actually pressed [Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical%20switches&tbm=isch)
- Keycaps: keycaps are plastic peices that go on top of switches [Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20keycaps&tbm=isch)
- PCB: a board having the microcontroller, usb port, rgb etc on which you attach the switches. Can be soldered or hotswap [Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20pcb%20switches&tbm=isch)
- Stabilizers: small contraptions that support big keycaps such as enter, shift, spacebar, backspace [Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20stabilizers&tbm=isch)
- Case: platic/metal(usually alu) body in which pcb is placed [Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20case&tbm=isch)

### Form Factors (pay more for less keys):
[Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20form%20factors&tbm=isch)
- 100%: regular keyboard with alphas + mods + num row + arrow cluster + fn row + nav cluster + numpad
- TKL: Tenkeyless, removes numpad. alphas + mods + num row + arrow cluster + fn row + nav cluster
- 75%: TKL but nav cluster is reduced to a single row of 3-4 keys. alphas + mods + num row + arrow cluster + fn row
- 65%: Fn Row is removed. alphas + mods + num row + arrow cluster
- 60%: Arrow cluster is removed. alphas + mods + num row
- 40%: Num row is removed. alphas + mods

### Layouts (for ergonomics):
[Images](http://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard%20layouts%20ergo%20split&tbm=isch)
- Regular staggered
- Ortholinear
- Alice
- Split
- Split row ortho column stagger

### Software:
- Manufacturer software support: change rgb modes, define layers/macros, remap keys
- [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware): open source keyboard firmware, can write code to define what happens when a key is pressed, very powerful
- VIA: via allows you to use qmk without writing code, just a UI interface to define qmk stuff

### Types of keyboards for sale:
- Prebuilt: keyboard comes with all parts and peices pre-assembled, just plug and play. Many budget keyboards are prebuilt.
- Barebones: comes without switches and keycaps (people in the hobby have multiple switches and keycaps already based on their preference, so sellers just skip them). May or may not have stabilizer. Many medium-high end boards come like this.
- QMK/VIA compatible: pcb's that have microcontrollers compatible with QMK are generally expensive, so qmk compatible keyboards are generally around >8-10k INR
